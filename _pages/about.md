# Research Interests

My research interests include **efficient machine learning**, particularly efficient training and inference. Recently, I am focusing on dynamic sparse training, quantization and speculative decoding. I want to break the monopoly of unicorns in AI and make deep learning affordable and accessible for every researcher.
